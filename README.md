# ✨ Cosmic Light Weaver: Space Explorer Game 🚀

**Cosmic Light Weaver** is an immersive 2D top-down space navigation game built using **C and OpenGL/GLUT**. Players control a spacecraft navigating an asteroid-filled maze, collecting energy cores, and escaping through a wormhole — all while racing against time and a depleting energy source.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- 🛰️ Navigate through procedurally generated asteroid fields
- ⚡ Collect glowing **energy cores** to restore light
- ⏳ Beat the **countdown timer** and escape via a **wormhole**
- 🧠 Each level is guaranteed solvable using **A\* Pathfinding**
- 🌌 Features dynamic **particle effects**, energy trails, and theme toggles (dark/light)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL (GLUT)
- **Algorithms**: A\* Pathfinding
- **Effects**: Particle Systems, Lighting, Trail Rendering

---

## 💡 Key Features

- **Grid-Based World** with smooth object transitions
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Player glow reflects energy level
- **Procedural Generation**: Every level is different, yet solvable
- **Visual FX**:
  - Particle systems (stars, nebulas, smoke trails)
  - Pulsing energy cores
  - Wormhole with animated accretion disk
- **Theme Toggle**: Light and dark cosmic aesthetics
- **Minimap** and responsive UI

---

## 🧪 Computer Graphics Concepts Implemented

- 2D Object Rendering (GL_TRIANGLES, GL_QUADS, etc.)
- 2D Transformations (Translation, Rotation, Scaling)
- Orthographic Projection (glOrtho)
- Particle Systems
- Collision Detection
- Procedural Environment and Path Generation
- Alpha Blending and Transparency
- Custom HUD, Menus, and State Management

---

## 🧠 AI/Algorithmic Highlights
